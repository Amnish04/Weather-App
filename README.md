# Weather-App
A basic weather web application that uses its own REST API to make requests to OpenWeatherMap API. The requests are kept on back-end to keep the API key a secret since it is exposed to the client/user when using on front-end. Technologies/Frameworks used are Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars.js, HTML5, CSS3 and Client-Side JS

#### Note: The application currently cannot access the user's current location when deployed in the cloud as it does not use HTTPS secure protocol. This feature will be enabled soon as the new version is rolled out with support for HTTPS.
